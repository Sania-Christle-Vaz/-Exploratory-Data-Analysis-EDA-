Titanic Data Analysis (EDA - Train Set)  This project conducts EDA on the Titanic train dataset using Python. It explores survival rates and key factors like age, gender, and class. Visualizations such as histograms, count plots, and heatmaps highlight patterns and relationships to understand survival trends.
Titanic Data Analysis (EDA - Train Set)
Overview
This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic train dataset to analyze passenger survival rates and identify patterns across different features like age, gender, passenger class, and fare. The goal is to uncover insights into factors that influenced survival during the Titanic disaster.

Objectives
Handle missing values in the dataset.

Analyze survival rates and key features.

Visualize data trends and relationships.

Derive actionable insights from the dataset.

Dataset
Source: Kaggle Titanic Dataset

Dataset Type: Train Set (Used for analysis)

Key Insights
Missing Data: The 'Age' column had missing values filled with the median. The 'Cabin' column had excessive missing data and was dropped.

Survival Rate: 38% of passengers survived. Women and 1st class passengers had higher survival rates.

Passenger Classes: Most passengers were in 3rd class, with 1st class passengers having the highest survival rate.

Age: The age distribution is right-skewed, with a slightly higher survival rate for younger passengers.

Gender: Women had a higher survival rate (~74%) compared to men (~18%).

Fare: Higher fares were correlated with 1st class and higher survival rates.

Visualizations
Histograms, boxplots, and count plots for understanding the distribution of features.

Heatmap for correlation analysis.

Pairplots to explore relationships between numerical variables.
